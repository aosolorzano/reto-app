## Description
This project uses the Spring Boot Framework to handle errors in a Spring Native application that uses WebFlux and i18n.
The idea is to use a TDD methodology from the beginning with the support of Testcontainers to execute the Integration Tests.
This project also uses Docker with the compose plugin to deploy a local cluster alongside the other required services by the Spring Boot microservice.

### Running the application using Docker Compose
Execute the following command from the root of the project:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## GraalVM Native Support

This project has been configured to let you generate either a lightweight container or a native executable.
It is also possible to run your tests in a native image.

### Lightweight Container with Cloud Native Buildpacks
If you're already familiar with Spring Boot container images support, this is the easiest way to get started.
Docker should be installed and configured on your machine prior to creating the image.

To create the image, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Pnative
```

Then, you can run the app like any other container:

```
$ docker run --rm reto-app:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

### Executable with Native Build Tools
Use this option if you want to explore more options such as running your tests in a native image.
The GraalVM `native-image` compiler should be installed and configured on your machine.

NOTE: GraalVM 22.3+ is required.

To create the executable, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw native:compile -Pnative
```

Then, you can run the app as follows:
```
$ target/reto-app
```

You can also run your existing tests suite in a native image.
This is an efficient way to validate the compatibility of your application.

To run your existing tests in a native image, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw test -PnativeTest
```
